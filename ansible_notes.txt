agentless - no master slave mode , just controller and managed nodes
setup networks , db , set configuration
automate security with vault

Automating Linux Administration with Ansible
1.agentless
2.cross platform support(ssh & winrm)
3.human readable:yaml, plaintxt
4.easy to put in VCS
5.dynamic inventory: update inventory from outside or inside
6.Orchestration and Integration is easy 
7.From dev to prod all

Ansible i python developed and dependent rich plugins with module plugins,inventory plugins
connection plugins(ssh connection plugin)
become plugins ( work as user)
cache,lookup,vars,callback (more plugins)


Ansible engine -> ansible core 
ansible tower -> ansible automation platform (deprecated at RH older version)

ansible can be run by DNF in RHEL
cmd--sudo dnf install -y ansible 
weekest 
1. /etc.ansible.cfg -- you need to be root
2.~/.ansible.cfg -- override as per user 
//project directory
3../ansible.cfg
//strongest

=====================
cfg file is used to apply settings for multiple ansible tools 
-It manages defaults and previlaged_escalations
//To generate default directives and configs 
ansible-config init --disabled > default_ansible.cfg
//to Dump or see them 
ansible-config dump 
example:
[defaults]

inventory = ./inventory #list of hosts

remote_user = user #user on managed nodes

ask_pass = false # no prompt for password

[privilege_escalation]

become = true #auto switch user

become_method = sudo 

become_user = root

become_ask_pass = false # ask password for become param

ex : 2 
inventory = ./myInventory/
remote_user:devops
collection_pathc=./collections/
=====================
Inventory : Manage hosts from diff sourses(satelite dir from RHEl. ms active directory ,etc.)
-ansible controlller can dynamically use by using plugins

cmd - ansible-inventory -i <.ini file> --graph // to show the structure 
cmd - ansible-inventory -i invetory.ini --list // in list

yaml playbooks : have many plays in one playbook with modules
 play1:
	tasks:
		task1:
		task2: ---> modules for appservers
 play2:
	tasks:
		task1:
		task2: ---> modules for webservers
EXAMPLE: 
---
- name: Configure important user consistently
  hosts: servera.lab.example.com
  tasks:
    - name: Newbie exists with UID 4000
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: newbie
        uid: 4000
        state: present
...
=========
YAML - YAML ain't a  markup language(human readable serializable language)
it supports key value pairs name : install httpd(no qutes required)
indentation is important
-dictionary:
  -name:yash
   email:yash@gmail.com
cmd --syntax-check //for checking playbook syntax
Imp: host key is play level not task level //better to use a editor
