# Ansible Notes

## Overview
- **Agentless**: No master-slave mode, just a controller and managed nodes.
- **Capabilities**:
  - Setup networks, databases, and configurations.
  - Automate security with Vault.

## Automating Linux Administration with Ansible
1. **Agentless**
2. **Cross-platform support** (SSH & WinRM)
3. **Human-readable** (YAML, plain text)
4. **Easy to version control**
5. **Dynamic inventory** (update inventory from inside or outside)
6. **Orchestration and integration** are easy
7. **From development to production**

## Ansible Architecture
- **Developed in Python** with rich plugin support:
  - **Module plugins**
  - **Inventory plugins**
  - **Connection plugins** (e.g., SSH connection plugin)
  - **Become plugins** (e.g., work as different users)
  - **Cache, lookup, vars, callback plugins**

## Ansible Components
- **Ansible Engine** â†’ Ansible Core
- **Ansible Tower** â†’ Deprecated, now **Ansible Automation Platform**
- **Installation on RHEL**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install -y ansible
  ```

## Configuration File (`ansible.cfg`)
Configuration files are applied in order of precedence:
1. `/etc/ansible.cfg` (system-wide, weakest)
2. `~/.ansible.cfg` (user-specific, overrides system-wide)
3. `./ansible.cfg` (project directory, stronger)
4. `ANSIBLE_CONFIG` environment variable (strongest)

### Generate default configuration:
```bash
ansible-config init --disabled > default_ansible.cfg
```
### View current configuration:
```bash
ansible-config dump
```

## Inventory Management
- Manage hosts from different sources (Satellite, Active Directory, etc.).
- Dynamic inventory using plugins.
- Example Inventory (`inventory.ini`):
  ```ini
  [webservers]
  servera
  serverb
  
  [dbservers]
  serverc
  serverd
  
  [rhel9]
  server[a:d]
  
  [rhel:children]
  rhel8
  rhel9
  ```
- Commands:
  ```bash
  ansible-inventory -i inventory.ini --graph   # Show inventory structure
  ansible-inventory -i inventory.ini --list    # Show inventory in list format
  ```
- Nested Groups Example:
  ```ini
  [usa]
  washington1.example.com
  washington2.example.com

  [canada]
  ontario01.example.com
  ontario02.example.com

  [north-america:children]
  canada
  usa
  ```

## YAML Playbooks
Playbooks contain multiple plays:
```yaml
---
- name: Configure important user consistently
  hosts: servera.lab.example.com
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure newbie user exists with UID 4000
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: newbie
        uid: 4000
        state: present
```

## YAML Basics
- YAML Ain't Markup Language (Human-readable, serializable)
- Supports **key-value pairs**:
  ```yaml
  name: install httpd  # No quotes required
  ```
- **Indentation is important**
- Dictionary Example:
  ```yaml
  - name: Yashwanth
    email: yash@gmail.com
  ```
- **Syntax check for playbooks**:
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook --syntax-check playbook.yml
  ```

## Variables in Ansible
- Must start with an alphabet.
- **22 different ways to define variables** (Keep it simple).
- Example variable definition methods:
  - `roles/defaults/`
  - `inventory/group_vars/varsFile.yaml`
- Variable Precedence: [Docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html#understanding-variable-precedence)

### Example Playbook Using Variables:
```yaml
---
- name: Printing my name
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local

  vars_files:
    - my_vars.yaml

  tasks:
    - name: Print name task
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "Hi {{ my_string }}"
```

### Example Using `set_fact` (Higher precedence):
```yaml
- name: Ensure fact controller learns about my vars
  ansible.builtin.set_fact:
    my_string: white  # Overrides any previous value
```

### Example Passing Variables from CLI:
```bash
ansible-playbook first.yaml -e my_string=Yashwanth -i inventory.ini
```

## Recommended Project Structure
```bash
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ ansible.cfg
â”œâ”€â”€ group_vars/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ datacenters
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ datacenters1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ datacenters2
â”œâ”€â”€ host_vars/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ demo1.example.com
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ demo2.example.com
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ demo3.example.com
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ demo4.example.com
â”œâ”€â”€ inventory
â””â”€â”€ playbook.yml
```

## RHEL System Roles
System roles provide automation for system configuration:
- **Common roles**:
  - `linux-system-roles.vpn`
  - `linux-system-roles.firewall`
  - `linux-system-roles.timesync`
  - `linux-system-roles.sshd`
  - `linux-system-roles.certificate`
  - `linux-system-roles.storage`
- Default location: `/usr/share/ansible-roles`
- More details: [RHEL System Roles](https://access.redhat.com/articles/3050101)

## Ansible Modules & Plugins
- **Modules**: Rich module collection with plugins
- **Collections**: Combination of plugins, modules, and roles.
- **Ansible Galaxy**: Import/export collections.
- **Core modules**:
  ```yaml
  - ansible.builtin.dnf:
  - ansible.posix.firewalld:
  - ansible.builtin.copy:
  - ansible.builtin.debug:
  ```
- Commands:
  ```bash
  ansible-galaxy collection list  # Show installed collections
  ansible-doc -l                  # List available modules
  ansible-doc copy                 # Show details of copy module
  ```

# Module 6: Handlers in Ansible

## What are Handlers?  
Ansible handlers are special tasks that are **executed only when notified** by another task. They help maintain **idempotency** by ensuring that certain actions (like restarting a service) run only when necessary.



## ðŸ“Œ Example 1: Kernel Update with Handlers  
```yaml
- name: Kernel Update
  hosts: localhost
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure kernel is updated
      ansible.builtin.dnf:
        name: kernel
        state: latest
      notify: Ensure system is rebooted

  handlers:
    - name: Ensure system is rebooted
      ansible.builtin.reboot:
        msg: "Rebooting due to kernel update"

ex 2:
tasks:
  - name: copy demo.example.conf configuration template
    ansible.builtin.template:
      src: /var/lib/templates/demo.example.conf.template
      dest: /etc/httpd/conf.d/demo.example.conf
    notify:
      - restart mysql
      - restart apache

handlers:
  - name: restart mysql
    ansible.builtin.service:
      name: mariadb
      state: restarted

  - name: restart apache
    ansible.builtin.service:
      name: httpd
      state: restarted
...
```
- done
## key points

- As discussed in the Ansible documentation, there are some important things to remember about using handlers:

- Handlers always run in the order specified by the handlers section of the play. They do not run in the order in which they are listed by notify statements in a task, or in the order in which tasks notify them.

- Handlers normally run after all other tasks in the play complete. A handler called by a task in the tasks part of the playbook does not run until all tasks under tasks have been processed. (Some minor exceptions to this exist.)

- Handler names exist in a per-play namespace. If two handlers are incorrectly given the same name, only one of them runs.

- Even if more than one task notifies a handler, the handler runs one time. If no tasks notify it, the handler does not run.

- If a task that includes a notify statement does not report a changed result (for example, a package is already installed and the task reports ok), the handler is not notified. Ansible notifies handlers only if the task reports the changed status.
---
## Conditionals
if few tasks share same property "block" is used 
 under block they can be written 

```yaml
- name: Conditional demo
  hosts: server_a
  gather_facts: true
  become: true
  
  tasks:
    - name: Verify OS is RHEL-based
      when: "'RedHat' in ansible_facts['distribution']"
      block:
        - name: Ensure message is displayed
          ansible.builtin.debug:
            msg: "We have matched RedHat to distribution"

        - name: Ensure httpd is installed
          ansible.builtin.dnf:
            name: httpd
            state: latest

        - name: Starting the service
          ansible.builtin.service:
            name: httpd
            state: started
            enabled: true
//example for suse:
- name: Conditional demo for SUSE
  hosts: server_a
  gather_facts: true
  become: true
  
  tasks:
    - name: Verify OS is SUSE-based
      when: "'SUSE' in ansible_facts['distribution']"
      block:
        - name: Ensure message is displayed
          ansible.builtin.debug:
            msg: "We have matched SUSE to distribution"

        - name: Ensure Apache (httpd) is installed
          ansible.builtin.zypper:
            name: apache2
            state: latest

        - name: Start and enable Apache service
          ansible.builtin.service:
            name: apache2
            state: started
            enabled: true
```
```yaml
ansible.builtin.assert:   //This will help to assert without stopping 
  that:
    -my package is defined
    - (my_package == "httpd") or (my_package == nginx
  success_msg:
	done
  fail_msg:
	failed at finding pck
```
## one more concept - rescue and always comes when block fails 
```yaml
tasks:

  name:
  ansible.builtin....

  name:
  block:
    -name: 


  rescue:

  alwsys:
```
** The supported_distros variable was created by the playbook author, and contains a list of operating system distributions that the playbook supports. If the value of ansible_facts['distribution'] is in the supported_distros list, the conditional passes and the task runs.**
```yaml
---
- name: Demonstrate the "in" keyword
Â Â hosts: all
Â Â gather_facts: yes
Â Â vars:
Â Â Â Â supported_distros:
Â Â Â Â Â Â - RedHat
Â Â Â Â Â Â - Fedora
Â Â tasks:
Â Â Â Â - name: Install httpd using dnf, where supported
Â Â Â Â Â Â ansible.builtin.dnf:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â name: http
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â state: present
Â Â Â Â Â Â when: ansible_facts['distribution'] in supported_distros

```
